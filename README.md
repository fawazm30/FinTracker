# FinTracker - A Finance Tracking Website (IN PROGRESS)

This full-stack website tracks the users' inputted transaction history, by letting the user set the budget, and to display any sort of financial reports, such as how much they spent on shopping alone. This project utilizes MySQL by storing user account information from the login page, transactions, and budgets (so far). This project also utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Currently, this project is in progress and might be completed by the end of July.
