# FinTracker

## A Finance Tracking Website (IN PROGRESS)

This full-stack website tracks the users' inputted transaction history by letting the user set the budget, and displays any sort of financial reports, such as how much they spent on shopping alone. This project utilizes MySQL by storing user account information from the login page, transactions, and budgets (so far). This project also utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Currently, this project is in progress and might be completed by the end of July.

Regarding my database, I am using Node.js (as my backend), which helps me run my main server, ```server.js```. The MySQL database is also stored within this server. I am also currently running this environment using Docker, since it containerizes my application, making it easier to run this program in any enivronment and helps ensure my dependencies, like Node.js and MySQL, are running correctly. In summary, Node.js is used for my backend, while Docker helps to ensure everything runs as it should.
